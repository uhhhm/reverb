 * startPlayTracker subscribes to the given engine and calls `recordFn` once per

 *
 * Qualification rules:
 *  - Track must have durationMs > 30 000 ms.
 *  - msPlayed must reach durationMs/2 OR 240 000 ms — whichever comes first.
 *  - Only genuine forward play time accrues: 0 < delta < 5 000 ms while playing.
 *    A backward seek (delta < 0) resets lastTimeMs without accruing — prevents
 *    DOUBLE-counting replayed seconds. A large forward jump (delta >= 5 000 ms)
 *    is a forward SEEK and is NOT accrued — prevents counting SKIPPED seconds as
 *    listened ones. These two guards are orthogonal.
 *  - Repeat-one re-loop (backward jump to near-0 on the SAME track after fire)
 *    resets the per-play counters so a second qualification can fire.
 *  - completed = currentTimeMs >= durationMs - 1 500 at fire time.
