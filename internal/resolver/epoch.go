// identity-CHANGED path).
//
// This is the single implementation shared by Service.BumpEpoch (resolver
// internal) and reconcileLibraryIdentity (wiring), ensuring both read and write
// the exact same key format.
//
// DEFERRED (P2/SP3): pieces (2) runScan targeted binding refresh and (3) async
// post-swap sweep are intentionally NOT wired here. They are best-effort
// pre-warming, not a correctness dependency — the resolver lazily re-resolves on
// a binding miss. In P1 there is NO canonical-keyed consumer to refresh yet
// (download jobs become canonical-keyed in Task 11, plays in SP3). The resolver
// is also constructed AFTER Builder.Build, so wiring it into Build-time
// reconcile/Manager would create a construction cycle. Revisit pre-warming in
// P2/SP3 once consumers are canonical-keyed.
