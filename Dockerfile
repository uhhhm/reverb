# Deno: current YouTube requires a JS runtime to solve its nsig/signature
# challenge. Without it, yt-dlp (and therefore spotDL) fails every download with
# "AudioProviderError: YT-DLP download error" and writes no file — spotDL itself
# prints "Some YouTube downloads require Deno". The official deno:bin image exists
# solely to be COPY'd in; /usr/local/bin is on PATH so yt-dlp finds it.
COPY --from=denoland/deno:bin /deno /usr/local/bin/deno
# Keep spotDL ITSELF current — that's the real fix for downloads "stuck at 0% /
# hangs on Processing query". That stage is ytmusicapi (the YouTube Music API),
# whose fix shipped in ytmusicapi 1.11.1 — gated behind spotdl >= 4.4.3. So the old
# 4.2.11 pin literally couldn't get the fix; bumping spotDL pulls a compatible
# ytmusicapi + yt-dlp. Pinned to a known-good latest via build arg for
# reproducibility — bump SPOTDL_VERSION + rebuild when downloads break again.
# yt-dlp (the actual download step) is additionally floated, since it goes stale
# between spotDL releases. Progress parsing degrades gracefully, so a spotDL
# output-format drift just falls back to an indeterminate spinner (never breaks).
ARG SPOTDL_VERSION=4.5.0
# spotDL is pinned for reproducibility, but yt-dlp is DELIBERATELY NOT pinnable:
# YouTube changes its signature/nsig scheme constantly, so a frozen yt-dlp goes
# stale within weeks and every download then fails with a bare "YT-DLP download
# error". Always install the latest at build time. NOTE: this only refreshes
# yt-dlp when the IMAGE is built — a long-running container still ages, so rebuild
# periodically (or `docker compose exec -u root reverb pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`
# to unstick a running one). Reverb invokes the spotDL download CLI, not its
# optional web server. spotDL 4.5.0 eagerly imports that server even for CLI use,
# retaining the vulnerable FastAPI/Starlette stack in every image. Make that import
# lazy and remove the unsupported web-server dependencies; package metadata is
# updated too, so `pip check` remains meaningful for the shipped runtime.
# YTDLP_BUILD_STAMP exists solely to bust this layer's cache: CI builds with
# cache-from/cache-to, which would otherwise reuse this RUN layer forever and
# silently freeze yt-dlp at whatever was latest when the layer was last built —
# exactly the staleness the --upgrade below is supposed to prevent. release.yml
# passes a per-run value; local/CI builds keep the default and stay cached.
