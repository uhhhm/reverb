# Deploying Reverb

> Fork of [uhhhm/reverb](https://github.com/uhhhm/reverb) — this guide is for [uhhhm/reverb](https://github.com/uhhhm/reverb) (`ghcr.io/uhhhm/reverb`).

Reverb ships as a single Docker image: a static Go binary with the web UI
embedded, plus Python 3, ffmpeg, and a pinned spotDL. This guide covers a
production-ish single-host deployment.

## Quick start

Compose pulls the published image (`ghcr.io/uhhhm/reverb`) — no source
checkout or build required:

```bash
mkdir reverb && cd reverb
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhhhm/reverb/main/docker-compose.yml
mkdir music
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8090 and complete the first-run wizard. Reverb uses the
`./music` folder, keeps its database in a managed Docker volume, and starts its
built-in music server and downloader automatically. Then add **Deezer** in
Settings for keyless catalog search.

Want to use an existing library, pin a release, or supply credentials? Download
the optional settings file and uncomment only the values you need:

```bash
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhhhm/reverb/main/.env.example
```

- `REVERB_MUSIC_DIR=/srv/music` uses an existing music folder instead of `./music`.
- `REVERB_VERSION=0.1.0` pins the image instead of following `latest`.
- `REVERB_DOWNLOAD_WORKERS=3` runs up to three downloads at once (default: two;
  maximum: four). This speeds up batches, not individual transfers.

### Trying alpha/prerelease builds

Prereleases (tagged e.g. `v0.3.0-alpha.1` on GitHub) are published under their
exact version *and* a moving `alpha` tag — they never update `latest`. Set
`REVERB_VERSION=alpha` to follow the newest prerelease, or pin an exact one
(e.g. `REVERB_VERSION=0.3.0-alpha.1`). Prereleases may include unfinished or
breaking changes; don't run them against a library you can't afford to lose.

To use your own library server, select **External Subsonic** in Settings →
Library backend and add its details there. Configure optional Spotify credentials
in `.env`.

## Folders

Reverb stores two things:

- **App state + SQLite DB** → the `reverb-data` **named volume** (`/data`). It needs
  no setup — the volume inherits the container's non-root ownership, so the DB just
  opens. (See [Backups](#backups) for copying it out.)
- **Your music library** → the `./music` **host folder** (`/music`), where spotDL
  downloads land and the bundled music server scans. Set `REVERB_MUSIC_DIR` in
  `.env` to use an existing library instead.

The container **runs non-root as uid 1000** (the typical first host user), so a
music folder you created/own is writable with **no `chown` and no `PUID`/`PGID`
config**. If your library is owned by a *different* user (e.g. a NAS share or a
service account), make it writable by uid 1000 before starting Reverb.

## The shared music folder

For downloads to appear in an external Subsonic/Navidrome server, it MUST scan
the same host music folder that you set with `REVERB_MUSIC_DIR`. After a download
completes, Reverb triggers a library scan and the track becomes playable.

## Expose bundled Navidrome locally

Bundled Navidrome listens only on `127.0.0.1` *inside* the Reverb container by
default. To connect a local development tool, make it listen on the container
network interface and publish the port only to your host loopback interface:

```yaml
# docker-compose.navidrome-local.yml
services:
  reverb:
    environment:
      REVERB_NAVIDROME_LISTEN_ADDRESS: 0.0.0.0
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4533:4533"
```

Start with `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.navidrome-local.yml up -d`.
Navidrome is then reachable at `http://localhost:4533`, but not from your LAN.
Do not publish this port on all interfaces. Reverb generates its bundled
Navidrome credentials internally, so this is intended for trusted local
development and diagnostics rather than a public Navidrome deployment.

## Reverse proxy + TLS

Run Reverb behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy. Reverb serves plain HTTP on
8090 and uses a same-origin session cookie + a WebSocket at `/api/v1/ws`, so the
proxy MUST forward Upgrade/Connection headers.

### Caddy (simplest)

```
music.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8090
}
```

Caddy obtains/renews certificates automatically and proxies WebSockets out of
the box.

> **Note:** Caddy sets `X-Forwarded-Proto` automatically. With nginx (below) you
> must set it yourself — the config already does.

### nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name music.example.com;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/music.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/music.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8090;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## Security / exposing to the internet

Before you expose Reverb beyond a trusted LAN:

- **Put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front of it.** Reverb serves plain HTTP. The browser UI on the server is implicitly authenticated as the single household owner (`local`) with no password; never expose port 8090 directly. Paired devices authenticate separately: `/sync` via Bearer sync tokens issued from one-time pairing codes (`POST /pairing/code` → `POST /pairing/redeem`, `XXXX-XXXX`, 10 min TTL, single-use) and P2P via libp2p peer IDs bound at pairing (`p2p_peer` trust set, Ed25519 keys). Treat pairing codes and sync tokens like passwords — they grant full sync and `can_manage_library` access.
- **The proxy must set/overwrite `X-Forwarded-Proto`** so Reverb knows the original request was HTTPS. Caddy does this automatically; the nginx config above sets it explicitly (`proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;`).
- Keep the data volume sensitive — see [Secrets at rest](#secrets-at-rest).

## Backups

In the default `docker-compose.yml` setup the database does **not** live in a host
`./data` directory — it lives inside the **`reverb-data` named Docker volume**
(mounted at `/data`). Back up:

- The `reverb-data` named volume — holds the SQLite database (`/data/reverb.db`)
  plus app state. This is the only stateful Reverb data worth backing up.
- Your `./music` folder — holds the downloaded audio (managed by your library
  server).

**Named volume (default):** copy the DB out of the volume. A cold copy is simplest:

```bash
docker compose stop reverb
docker run --rm -v reverb_reverb-data:/data -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" \
  busybox cp /data/reverb.db /backup/reverb-$(date +%F).db
docker compose start reverb
```

(The volume is `<project>_reverb-data` — `reverb_reverb-data` when the compose
directory is `reverb`; run `docker volume ls` to confirm.) You can also
`docker cp reverb:/data/reverb.db ./reverb-$(date +%F).db` against a running
container, though a stopped-container copy is safest for SQLite.

**Bind-mount alternative:** if you changed `docker-compose.yml` to bind-mount the
data dir instead (e.g. `- ./data:/data`), then the DB really is at host
`./data/reverb.db` and you can back it up with a plain file copy while the
container is stopped.

### Secrets at rest

Adapter credentials (Spotify Client Secret, Subsonic/Navidrome password, Lidarr
API key), the bundled-Navidrome admin password, and paired-device sync tokens
(`device.token_hash`) plus pairing codes (`pairing_code`) are currently stored
**unencrypted** in the SQLite database. P2P peer bindings (`p2p_peer`) and per-device
Ed25519 verification keys (`device.public_key`) and signed sync changes
(`sync_change.sig`, HLC vector) are also persisted for CRDT convergence. Treat the
data volume (and any DB backups you copy out) as **sensitive**: restrict file
permissions, keep backups off shared storage, and don't commit them anywhere.

## Upgrades

```bash
docker compose pull       # fetch the new published image (bump REVERB_VERSION to pin)
docker compose up -d      # recreate the container
```

Building from source instead? Use `git pull && docker compose build && docker
compose up -d` (with the compose `build:` block uncommented).

Reverb runs SQLite migrations automatically on startup. Back up the database
before a major upgrade (see [Backups](#backups) — by default it lives in the
`reverb-data` named volume, not a host `./data` dir).

## spotDL version pin

The image pins `spotdl==4.5.0` (via the `SPOTDL_VERSION` build arg in the
Dockerfile). spotDL's stdout formatting is fragile and
Reverb parses download progress with the regex `(\d{1,3})\s*%`
(`internal/download/spotdl/adapter.go`). **Bumping the spotDL pin requires
re-validating that regex against the new output format** before shipping —
otherwise progress may silently degrade to "indeterminate".

## Desktop (Wails)

The desktop app wraps the same Go monolith in a Wails window and serves the SPA on `127.0.0.1:0` — no Docker, no `192.168.x.x:8090`. Downloads and sync run while the window is open (`close→quit`).

### Prerequisites

- **Linux:** `sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev pkg-config` (WebKitGTK). `CGO_ENABLED=1` is required for Wails; `modernc.org/sqlite` stays pure Go.
- **macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

### Build & run

```bash
make desktop      # web build + Go build -tags desktop -> ./dist/reverb-desktop
make desktop-dev  # wails dev -projectdir ./desktop (Vite at :5173, Go on 127.0.0.1:0)
make desktop-deps # fetch per-OS ffmpeg static + Navidrome + deno + python venv into desktop/tools/
```

Bundled tools (ffmpeg static, Navidrome 0.62.0, spotDL 4.5.0, yt-dlp, deno) are embedded per-OS so the app is self-contained (~150–180 MB). `desktop/wails.json` sets frontend `../web`, build `npm run build`, dev server `http://localhost:5173`, fallback `index.html`.

### Data locations

- **DB:** `~/Library/Application Support/Reverb/reverb.db` (macOS) / `~/.config/reverb/reverb.db` (Linux, XDG via `os.UserConfigDir`). `REVERB_DB` overrides. On first launch `MaybeMigrateLegacyDB` copies `./data/reverb.db` if the desktop DB is missing.
- **Downloads:** `~/Music/Reverb` (`REVERB_DOWNLOAD_DIR` overrides, created if missing) — also the built-in Navidrome scan dir.

### macOS Gatekeeper (unsigned v1)

The app is unsigned. On first launch right-click the `.app` / `.zip` → **Open** → **Open** to bypass Gatekeeper. A future release will be signed and notarized.

### Auto-update

The desktop polls GitHub Releases (`GET /repos/<owner>/<name>/releases/latest`) on startup and every 6 h (stable channel only). The repository defaults to `uhhhm/reverb` and is set with `REVERB_UPDATE_REPO` / `--update-repo`; `off` disables the check (both the desktop poller and the web UI banner — `/api/v1/version` then reports an empty `updateRepo`). When a newer semver tag is found the UI shows an update banner; confirming replaces the binary in-place via `go-selfupdate` and restarts. `yt-dlp` is hot-upgraded separately every 24 h via `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp` without an app restart.

CI builds `reverb-desktop-$VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.{zip,deb,AppImage}` via `.github/workflows/desktop.yml` (matrix `macos-14` + `ubuntu-22.04` × `amd64`/`arm64`, `wails build -platform $GOOS/$GOARCH -ldflags "-X main.version=$TAG"`).
