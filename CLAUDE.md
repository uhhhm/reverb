## What this is

This is a fork of Reverb, a self-hosted music app. It is an Go single-binary modular monolith with an
embedded React/TypeScript SPA. It unifies an existing music library (Subsonic/
Navidrome), online search (Deezer/Spotify), and one-click downloading (spotDL)
in one web UI. License is AGPL-3.0-only.

IMPORTANT: This is a fork, so published instructions and README are may be out of date. Keep this in mind when working and giving user advice. Furthermore, although it is single-user, you should still be security-conscious.

## Commands

```bash
# Backend tests — NEVER use ./... ; web/node_modules contains vendored Go
go test ./cmd/... ./internal/...

# Frontend (from web/)
cd web && npm install
npm run test          # vitest unit/component tests
npm run e2e            # Playwright, hermetic/mocked
npm run lint            # eslint

# make targets
make gen     # regenerate sqlc code (queries -> Go) into internal/store/db
make web     # build the SPA, copy web/dist -> internal/api/dist
make build   # web + production binary (-tags prod) -> ./reverb
make test    # backend tests + frontend unit tests
make clean   # remove build artifacts

# Run locally (two shells, hot reload)
cd web && npm run dev          # shell 1: Vite dev server
go run ./cmd/reverb --dev       # shell 2: Go server proxying Vite, prints URL (default :8090)

# Run a single Go test
go test ./internal/download/... -run TestName -v

# Run a single frontend test file
cd web && npx vitest run src/lib/downloadApi.test.ts
```

Go 1.23+, Node 22+. gofmt-clean is required (`gofmt -w` before committing).
Conventional Commits (`feat(scope): …`, `fix(scope): …`, `test(scope): …`, etc.).
TDD is the norm — git history shows RED-phase `test(...)` commits followed by
implementation commits; keep suites green.

## Architecture

### Adapter/seam pattern (the core design)
## Project rules

**Write the current truth, not its history.** Do not layer a correction on top of
a claim you are correcting — delete the claim and state what is true now.

Likewise for decisions: a section headed "the open decision" followed by
"resolved" followed by "superseded" is archaeology. Record what is being done and
why. Delete the rest.

Do not pad documentation and docstrings with filler sections, redundant summaries, or boilerplate.

**Responding:** Keep responses focused, brief, and concise. Keep disclaimers and caveats short, and spend most of the response on the main answer. 

## Developing

- When asked to commit, commit on main branch. Do not create seperate branches.
- Do not user claude browser to preview/test - the user does this themselves.
- Use ripgrep instead of grep - its much faster.
Reverb has three pluggable seams, each with the same shape:

- **`library`** (Subsonic/Navidrome) — `internal/library/library.go` defines the
  interface; `internal/library/subsonic` and `internal/library/embedded` are
  concrete adapters; `internal/library/conformance.go` is a shared test suite
  every adapter must pass.
- **`search`** (Deezer / Spotify) — `internal/search/search.go` interface;
  `internal/search/deezer`, `internal/search/spotify` adapters;
  `internal/search/aggregator.go` fans a query out to all enabled sources
  concurrently (SSE streaming); `internal/search/conformance.go`.
- **`downloader`** (spotDL) — `internal/download/download.go` interface;
  `internal/download/spotdl`, `internal/download/lidarr` adapters;
  `internal/download/conformance.go`.

New adapters register explicitly at the composition root — **no `init()`
side-effects**. The registry (`internal/registry/registry.go`) holds
constructors by name; `internal/wiring/wiring.go` builds the active
library/search/download services from the enabled `adapter_instance` DB rows.
Wiring is invoked both at startup (`cmd/reverb`) and on live adapter
config changes via the API (no restart required) — see `cmd/reverb/reload.go`
and `internal/api` adapter mutation handlers.

Library backend has two modes (`internal/library/embedded`): **built-in**
(bundles Navidrome as a supervised child process against the same music dir)
and **external** (points at a user-provided Subsonic/Navidrome server). Only
built-in mode wires a local music dir into the subsonic adapter (enables the
waveform-peaks endpoint via local file access).

### Composition & control flow

- `cmd/reverb/main.go` / `serve.go` — composition root: opens the store, runs
  migrations, builds adapters via `wiring`, starts the HTTP server.
- `internal/core` — cross-cutting domain types and orchestration
  (`download.go`, `coverage.go`, `request.go`, `playlistsync.go`,
  `notification.go`, `external.go`) that coordinate across the seams.
- `internal/events/bus.go` — in-process EventBus; backs both the WebSocket
  (`internal/api/stream.go`) and the download manager's progress events. This
  is the primary way backend state changes reach the frontend live.
- `internal/matching` — matches search results against the library (by
  ISRC/metadata) to determine what's already owned.
- `internal/resolver` — resolves adapter/track identity across sources.
- `internal/store` — SQLite (via `modernc.org/sqlite`), migrations in
  `internal/store/migrations/*.sql` (goose), generated query code in
  `internal/store/db` (via sqlc — run `make gen` after editing
  `internal/store/queries`).
- `internal/api` — HTTP handlers (chi router). API is documented in OpenAPI,
  served live at `/api/v1/openapi.yaml` — keep it in sync with handler
  changes. `internal/api/embed.go` embeds the built SPA (`-tags prod`).
- `internal/auth` — session/cookie auth; `internal/registry` roles system
  files live alongside in `internal/api/roles.go`, `users.go`.

### Frontend (`web/`)

React 19 + TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, Zustand, Tailwind, react-router.
- `web/src/routes/` — one file per page (Home, Library, Search, Album, Artist,
  Downloads, Requests, Settings, Admin, Stats, ...), each with a co-located
  `*.test.tsx`.
- `web/src/lib/` — API clients (`*Api.ts`, thin fetch wrappers per backend
  resource), Zustand stores (`*Store.ts`: player, download, coverage, auth,
  library revision, everywhere/search, now-playing, pending-play), and
  cross-cutting utilities (`audioEngine.ts`, `mediaSession.ts`,
  `playTracker.ts`, `realtime.ts` for the WebSocket connection,
  `paletteService.ts`/`paletteWorker.ts` for cover-art color extraction).
- `web/src/components/` — shared UI components.
- Dev mode: Go proxies Vite (`--dev` flag) for hot reload; production build
  embeds the SPA into the Go binary via `-tags prod`.

### Configuration

Flags > environment variables > defaults. See README.md for the full flag/env
reference (`--port`/`REVERB_PORT`, `--db`/`REVERB_DB`, `--dev`/`REVERB_DEV`,
`REVERB_DOWNLOAD_DIR`, `REVERB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (first-run only),
`REVERB_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `REVERB_LIBRARY_PASSWORD`,
`REVERB_SPOTDL_PATH`, `REVERB_NAVIDROME_BIN`). Secrets are env/`.env`-only,
never committed; `.env` is gitignored, `.env.example` is the template.

### Linting

`.golangci.yml` enables errcheck, govet, ineffassign, misspell, staticcheck,
unconvert. Deferred-`Close()` errcheck ignores are pre-configured for common
`io.Closer` types. staticcheck runs "all" minus a few disabled stylistic
checks (QF1001, QF1003, ST1000, ST1003 — the last because existing naming uses
initialisms like `CoverUrl` pervasively, not `CoverURL`).

## Project rules (important)

**Write the current truth, not its history.** Do not layer a correction on top of
a claim you are correcting — delete the claim and state what is true now.

Likewise for decisions: a section headed "the open decision" followed by
"resolved" followed by "superseded" is archaeology. Record what is being done and
why. Delete the rest.

Do not pad documentation and docstrings with filler sections, redundant summaries, or boilerplate. Keep it concise, short and straight to the point!!! (please)

**Responding:** Keep responses focused, brief, and concise. Keep disclaimers and caveats short, and spend most of the response on the main answer.
